      <p class="text-info">AgileFoo has several goals: It is a place to save and share links, much like bit.ly (bitmarks) or reddit, but agile related. And it is a place to discuss and learn the 'values', 'principles' and 'practices' of agile software development.</p>
      <p class="text-info">AgileFoo is an open source RoR project and is available to anyone, whether your need is a simple 'link saver' or discussion forum.  <br><br>Perhaps your goal is to explore and learn agile development and agile testing. If so, then download the code. Explore, Learn and share. There are numerous opportunities to enhance this project with new features. So, write some user stories, write some tests and then write some code. And ideally use the discussion board to share your progress and discoveries.<br><br>

            <p>This is my lab to explore and learn TDD, BDD and ATDD. Initially, the exploration and learning will center upon tests written in Rspec. Then the exploration will shift to investigating Cucumber and Capybara.</p>
